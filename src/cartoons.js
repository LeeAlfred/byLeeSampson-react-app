caption:"A team culture without empathy is like trying to cook a cake without putting it in the oven. You may have all the other ingredients mixed together but the magic doesn’t happen until you apply the warmth (Empathy). When trying to get your team from Point A to Point B with empathy consider using this imagery. Think of the individual's feelings like the contents of the mugs when carrying a full tray of hot drinks. Too fast you risk spilling what's important to them, too slow and the drinks will be cold and if you don't look ahead you may trip up on obstacles and spill it all."

A way to bring balance and engagement in communication is to create a safe space to hear the other person too. Try an open ended question about the ‘feeling’ of what is being discussed. Be comfortable with the time and silence it takes for a thoughtful response. If you notice you talk more in the next interaction you have, consider using the see-saw imagery and see if it helps."

If done well this development has two focus points, their current role and their future role. With the flowers metaphor, you can plant the seed, provide them with all they need to grow in that environment. They can blossom into something beautiful but they will always remain where their roots are. The butterflies metaphor is very similar BUT includes taking the time to understand where they see themselves in their future. With that knowledge you can work together to develop an engaging coaching/skill development program for their now and for their future. The outcomes include increased trust, more engagement and higher job satisfaction.  "

I was new in a more senior role, with new responsibilities, projects and leading a team of leaders. I felt like my time and attention was being pulled in many directions and I was genuinely panicking about meeting deadlines. I sat down with my manager who asked to see my calendar. Apart from various meetings and coaching's scheduled there were gaps in my day. We sat down and started to look at how I could be more proactive about blocking out time in my calendar for specific items and ALSO SCHEDULING TIME ON A FRIDAY to prepare the following weeks' calendar. It sounds so simple but that one strategy gave me back time, increased my productivity, my availability to the team and eliminated the feelings of juggling too many priorities. Try blocking out the most important items first ('one on one' time with individuals in the team should make that list). Then back fill with the other priorities including breaks for you. I personally like to share my calendar with the team so they know where I am and why. Have you got time to try this for next week?"

One of the most difficult skills to learn as a coaching leader is making the effort and investing the time to find the person being coached doing it the right way and using that as three quarters of their coaching. Catching-out, is the natural and understandable default setting in coaching where the focus is solely on what went wrong, or could have been done better. With the catching-out method, overtime people will associate coaching sessions with negativity and a non-valuable use of their time to be avoided. Catching your people doing it right however and using it in coaching to celebrate the successes delivers a more positive coaching experience, positive reinforcement and is just as likely (if not more) to lead to earlier adoption of the required skill.",

Leadership is a difficult role as every person in a team is unique, bringing unique perspective, behaviours and expectations. This creates a multitude of variables in an environment where the win is a team enjoying working and succeeding as one. Identifying another leader who you can share your challenges with and learn from isn’t about helping you solve your problems. It’s about identifying leadership themes and helping grow your experience in embracing them. Finding someone to help guide you through a challenging experience and be better off because of it makes it more likely you will do the same for the individuals you lead, making you the ideal leader."

Here are some tips that took my meetings from rambling shambles to a highlight of my week. Send out invites with an agenda that includes: time, room, a time allocation of items being discussed and any pre-reading you can reasonably expect done prior. Start on time and aim to finish early. A meeting with a snack of some kind is generally well received. If you have the time at the beginning and if it is appropriate some form of fun activity. Celebrate any team successes while everyone is together. Start with important items first and anticipate allocating time for questions and clarifications. A clear goal, timeframes, roles and responsibilities. A Note taker who can share the minutes and goals afterwards"

The power of authentic, positive feedback from a manager on a job well done has flow on benefits to the individual, their growth and team culture. Consider keeping a simple tally of interactions. Mark one column for positive feedback on a job well done and another for constructive coaching. The ideal is around four pieces of positive feedback to every constructive feedback. Why? Try thinking of it like this. Compliments and positive feedback on work well done are like helium balloons, uplifting and fun. Constructive feedback is more like a rock, feels a bit heavier and grounds you to your current place in your development. If your goal is always to keep your people progressing up, then you would need more helium balloons than rocks.",

The cautionary tale to avoid is applying what works for you as a universal fit for everyone.

I’ve been in leadership roles for the past twenty years and I know first hand how hard it can feel sometimes. You get asked the hard questions that couldn’t be answered. You have to make the difficult decisions and have the difficult conversations that no-one really wants to have and you’re making decisions that impact the lives of customers and the people you lead. It adds up. It’s important that you are aware you need to take the time to recharge throughout a day. Think of the well worn analogy of ‘putting out fires’. Fire-breaks in the bush are a solution born out of a necessity to prevent fires from getting out of control and to make it easier to manage. A 10 minute mindfulness break, such as a quiet coffee out of the office, meditation or a walk are all forms of ‘Fire-Breaks’ to help ensure you are fully charged to deal with what comes your way.",

  caption: "The most important facet of leadership, in my experience, is the ability to connect. If you can lead from the front by connecting with people, taking the time to “care” about what is important to them and sharing what's important to you, the dynamic of a team culture changes. Consider this, there are 168 hours in a 7 day week. If the people you work with do a 40 hour work week, that means roughly 75% of their time is spent elsewhere. That makes up a majority percentage of who they are and what they care about and that has a big influence on who/how they are at work. Being genuine about taking the time to care about that 75% of them is the key to connection. Connections are bonds. Strong bonds bring teams closer together. Being closer together makes it easier to communicate, making it easier to all head in the same direction, at the same time, and for the right reasons.",

It is over-reliant on the manager. Consider Leader-B the “command and control manager”. A clear goal, a structure and drive to get there fast but the communication is all one way. In this case the team carries the manager and the structure is over-reliant on those doing most the work. Consider Leader-C the “collaborative manager”. Everyone is on the same level, communicating and sharing information, sharing the work and supporting each other. In this case the reliance is shared equally ('many feet make light work').",

People are more likely to follow your actions than your words. If you’re not being mindful of your actions, you might be inadvertently undermining what you are setting out to achieve. And just importantly, this doesn’t mean you should be fake. It means that if you are having concerns and doubts, it is likely others are too.

Always being honest and authentic (e.g. if you don’t know the answer it’s better to go with that, than a bluff).

Auditory or Visual Learners? How do they prefer to get positive and constructive feedback? In private? Written down and a chance to digest it?

  caption: "There are many reasons why it’s good to grow your ability to feel comfortable with being uncomfortable in a leadership role. Firstly being able to lead by example and stepping outside your comfort zone in taking on new challenges is going to help a team feel more at ease with change. Secondly and just as importantly, there will be situations where you are going to feel uncomfortable having a conversation that needs to be had with a team member. Delaying these conversations, though appealing, will not help either party. Finally, the more you experience at becoming comfortable with the uncomfortable, the better your reactions will be in those situations. Which is a win-win for everyone.",

  caption: "You can read and study leadership theory but the best way to learn is by doing. Having someone experienced to guide you helps shorten the learning curve and soften the bumps. Creating a weekly space to catch up with someone to share experiences and get advice is an investment in your skills.",

  caption: "Taking the time to learn the different types of bias people commonly employ in work environments helps to better understand what it will take to get a Team to the same start line, pointed in the same direction, running the same race. It was a revelation for me to learn about confirmation bias, anchoring bias, self-serving bias and others. If you haven’t heard the terms I recommend searching ‘bias types’ and looking at the common ones.",
